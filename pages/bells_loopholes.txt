## Bell's Loopholes

So far, we have seen that the Quantum world behaves in a way that is quite surprising. Apparently, if I create an entangled pair of quanta, the outcome of measuring one quanta affects the other instantly, across all space and time. That's definitely not how we experience the world with our senses.

Really, though, even individual quanta behave in this odd way too, although I think it is a little easier to accept. Let's send out a single photon somewhere, and set up multiple detectors for recording. We will only get one detector to click in this scenario, despite the probability of detection being about the same for each detector. That's already weird - does the probability amplitude just disappear everywhere, all at once, when a detector clicks? If the detectors are far about, how does one detector know *not* to click because it was already detected? If there is a little tickle on each detector, they must collaborate somehow to guarantee that only one click happens.

At this point, people get creative. Does the wavefunction disappear (or "collapse")? Or does the Universe split off into multiple copies, where we only experience one of the outcomes, but every outcome actually "happens"? Or does one of the detectors become "entangled" with the photon, making the detection probability absurdly small everywhere else? Believe or not, the math is the same[1](bell-loopholes-footnotes) in every case, so whichever interpretation seems more comforting to you is fine. Here at JTP we will stick to using math (which is precise at least) unless the interpretation leads us to something we can test.

In the example we gave so far violating Bell's Inequality, the photons were detected in a lab (where presumably the two photons were only separated by several meters at most.) That means the light-distance between detectors is very small, probably on the order of nanoseconds ($10^{-9} s$). To illustrate this, here is a diagram often used to show how

**Figure 1**: Space-time diagram of two detectors. The gray triangle represents "space-like" separation of the detectors, where any communication between Detector 1 (D1) and Detector 2 (D2) would violate causality.

But what if I want to put the detectors miles apart? It turns out this isn't very easy to do, because the photons can get lost along the way. I haven't included any non-ideal behavior so far because it just complicates the point I was trying to make. But if you DO include losses, then it doesn't take very many missed photons (or random noise detections) to make the uncertainty in our experiments large enough to give Bell some wiggle room.

Furthermore, not only do we want the detectors very far apart (and yet not losing any photons), but we also want to be able to set the the detector settings (in our previous example, the half-wave plate angles) independently before we detect any photons. Even a 3 kilometer separation between detectors is a light-time distance of $(3\times 10^{3} m)/(3\times 10^8 m/) = 10^{-5} s$ or $10 \mu s$. Obviously, you aren't going to be turning the half-wave plates by hand!

Finally, there is the problem of just what settings are chosen for the half wave plates. As long as we are talking about absurdities, what if our random detector setting generators are somehow correlated? We don't know how, but it could be a way to wiggle out of Bell's Inequality.

Closing all these loopholes simultaneously is _hard_ - but it has been done in this 2015 Nature paper by Hensen et al. Note that Hensen used the [Barrett-Kok](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0408040) method to entangle two nitrogen vacancy spin centers (that were physically separated by over a kilometer!) That would take a LOT of explaining to describe, but the key step in entanglement of widely-separated quantum systems is something that also seems too simple to be true: they shoot two photons (one generated by each system) at the opposite sides of a beam splitter located somewhere between the two objects. The photons are nominally identical, so there is no way even in principle to tell which photon goes to which detector, which entangles the initial two quantum systems.

**Figure 2**: Entangling two quantum systems with a beam splitter. It seems too simple.

The output of the ports on a classical beam-splitter just mean we are adding two beams together with some relative phase. The output of the ports always sum to one (energy is conserved of course) but the power in either arm oscillates back and forth with the phase difference between the incident light beams $E_A$ and $E_B$. So:

$$E_C = (T_{BC}+R_{AC})\sin(k\Delta x)$$
$$E_D = (T_{AD}+R_{BD})\cos(k\Delta x)$$
$$ |E_C|^2 + |E_D|^2 = |E_A|^2 + |E_B|^2  $$

What about when we use quantum particles? Remember, we can't subdivide a single photon, but we can put a single photon in a superposition of outputs of each port.

The key step in figuring out how a quantum beam-splitter behaves is conservation of probabability (or a property known as "unitarity".) Let's formally write out what a beamsplitter $U$ _does_:

$$ \left[\begin{matrix}c \\ d \right] $$

Like conservation of energy in the classical case, unitarity requires:

So now, the beam-splitter matrix looks like:

Each port therefore takes a photon and transforms it into a superposition of the two ports with the phases added from the above matrix. Like so:

This yields a famous and surprising result. The cross terms cancel exactly and leave the output state as:

That is a superposition of $\left|2,0\right>$ or $\left|0,2\right>$! So when identical photons arrive at the splitter from either side simultaneously, the detectors receive _two_ photons on one detector and _zero_ photons on the other! There is no classical analogue to this result, the eponymous [Hong-Ou-Mandel](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2044) effect. Because one of the output ports always contains no photons, the cross-correlation of the output ports drops to zero when the photons at the input are truly interchangeable. (Parenthetically, the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect was published in 1987, my first year of graduate school. I like to think that is very recent for a novel quantum effect.)

This interchangeability of photons is actually pretty deep and cosmic - you can't scratch a bar-code on a quantum and tell it apart from another quantum of the same type. In this case the indistiguishability of the two photons leads to a final wave function of the overall system that is entangled.

The entangled wavefunctions on the left and right are:

$$\Psi_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left|HV\right>_L+\left|VH\right>_L\right]
$$\Psi_R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\left|HV\right>_R+\left|VH\right>_R\right]

The overall system state at this point is the factorizable product

$$\Psi_T = \Psi_L\otimes\Psi_R$$ 

Now, we apply the beam splitter:

This is the magic part - we have to "measure" the output of the beam splitter by projecting the $\left|\Psi\right>_{C,D}$ states onto the overall wave function. Basically, this means we have to verify that we actually get the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip - if we detect two photons, one photon on each detector, then we are assured that the wavefunctions are _not_ entangled. 

This measurement is represented by taking the product of:

$$\left<20|_C\right|\left<02\right|_D\left|\Psi_T\right>$$

Mathematically, this measurement _removes_ the center terms, making the overall wavefunction unfactorizable, and thus leaves behind an entangled $L,R$ state.

The Hensen _et al._ paper above used beam-splitter entanglement, but they didn't entangle  photon pairs, but physical spins in two different nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. Which is even _more_ wild.

By the way, this isn't a very efficient method of generating entangled pairs.

Finally, I'll mention that another group used photons gathered from two stars on opposite sides of the universe - these stars were _light years_ apart. There is no way they could communicate with one another. Yet Bell's Inequality is still violated! 

So to summarize, here are the common loopholes that have all been closed at the same time:

(1) Measurements done too close together (too fast)
(2) Measurements with too much loss (too noisy)
