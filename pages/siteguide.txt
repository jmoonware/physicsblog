## Overall Site Guide to JTP

#### Meta-post guide to all the posts that will (eventually) be found on JTP

I generally post on topics that require multiple posts to explain. So this site has grown to the point that we need a "guide to the guides", which should encompass more or less everything that is here. 

Don't worry, you can still sort on difficulty level or date (the default.) 

So, without further ado, here is the guide to the guides!

- ** Guide 1: ** A [summary](summary) of the site, with links to the basics
  - Start here - it's perma-linked in the navigation gizmo
  - Links to the posts that give the minimum amount of math to make sense of this site
- ** Guide 2: ** [The Bell's Inequality Series](bell-series)
  - All that spooky "action at a distance" stuff in Quantum Mechanics
- ** Guide 3: ** [The Quantum Computing Series](quantum-computing-series)
  - A lot more than you ever wanted to know about Quantum Computing
  - Includes posts about RSA encryption, and some backgroun Group Theory information that is needed to understand some of the problems addressed with Quantum Computing
- ** Guide 4: ** Quantum Field Theory
  - Conjugates the verb "to quantize"
  - Zero-point energy and why we shouldn't let infinity bother us (including some of the weirder implications, e.g. the Casimir Force.)
  - Why everything is really a field, but insisting we don't use particles is pointy-headed
- ** Guide 5: ** Financial Topics I Find Interesting
  - Call options and Black-Scholes - how to make fancy side-bets at the stock market casino, and why I am an index investor
  - Cryptocurrencies - why are we heating the planet to chase numbers?
  - High speed trading - useful arbitrage, or everything that is wrong with Wall Street?
